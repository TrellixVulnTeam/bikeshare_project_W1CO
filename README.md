# bikeshare_project
Analyis of Chicago bikeshare users.


**Questions**
We will start by asking questions we may want to know about the dataset. What information would we want to know in order to make smarter business decisions? Or if we are a user what might affect how we use the service.
Below are the questions that could be asked by someone who is working for Motivate:
1.	What are the Stations with high activity
2.	What is the average trip duration.
3.	Who are the users with high trip duration.
4.	User Types with high Trip Duration.
5.	Average Age Group of users.
6.	Times with the most activity.
